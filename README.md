# Incompressible2D
Custom discontinuous Galerkin / Fourier spectral solver for incompressible 2D Navier-Stokes equation

This repo contains experiments of convection/diffusion systems using high-order discontinuous Galerkin methods towards:
1) concisely-coded and efficient GPU implementations,
2) some experimental spectral methods for the pressure Poisson equation and viscosity
